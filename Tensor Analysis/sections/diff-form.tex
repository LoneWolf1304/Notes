\section{Bit of  Differential Geometry: Dayuum!!}
Let us look into a bit of differential geometry which is a formal way of treating this tensor thingy. We will try to be as intuitive and non-rigorous as possible (and thus increasing our chances of making a mathematician crazy!) but yeah, we will try to be rigorous enough so that I am satisfied.
\subsection{Some prior things}
Before touching manifolds, let us define what an abstract topological space is, since manifolds are special case of topological spaces. Basically, a topological space is a set $(X, \tau )$ where $\tau \subset \mathcal{P}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\emptyset, X \in \tau$.
    \item $U_\alpha \in \tau \implies \bigcup \limits_{\alpha\in J} U_\alpha \in \tau$  (closed under arbitrary union).
    \item $U_i \in \tau \implies \bigcap \limits_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau$  (closed under finite intersection)\footnote{Here $\alpha$ index is used when we want the indexing set $J$ (indexing set means the set from where the incides to denote the elements of the set are taken from) to be arbitrary, meaning that the set $\{U_\alpha\}$ can be finite, countable or uncountable. On the other hand, index $i$ is mostly used when the indexing set is finite.}.
\end{itemize}
Well well, this does not look anything like coffee cup and donut which most people associate topology with. That is a case of \textit{homeomorphism} which will be discussed later (hopefully). However, for now let us proceed. The sets belonging to $\tau$ are called \textbf{open sets}. We define a \textbf{closed set} as a set whose complement is open. There are umpteen other definitions like \textbf{closure, boundary, interior, neighbourhood}, etc. Let define few of them \emoji{loudly-crying-face}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Closure} of a set $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$ and is denoted by $\overline{A}$.
    \item \textit{Interior} of a set $A$ is the largest open set contained in $A$ and is denoted by $\text{int}(A)$.
    \item \textit{Boundary} of a set $A$ is the set of points which are neither in the interior nor in the exterior of $A$ and is denoted by $\partial A$.
    \item If $p\in X$, then a \textit{neighbourhood} of $p$ is a set $N$ such that there exists an open set $U\in \tau$ with $p\in U\subseteq N$.
\begin{figure}[H]

      \input{plot&diagrams/neighbourhood.tex}
      \caption{Neighbourhood of a point $p$ in  $X$}
\end{figure}
          \item \textit{Hausdorff Space}: A topological space is called Hausdorff if for any two distinct points $x,y\in X$, there exist open sets $U,V\in \tau$ such that $x\in U, y\in V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \input{plot&diagrams/hausdorff.tex}
      \caption{A \textbf{Hausdorff Space}, where the points $x$ and $y$ are separated by the open sets $U$ and $V$.}
    \end{figure}
    \item \textit{Topological Continuity}: A function $f: X \to Y$ between two topological spaces is said to be continuous if for every open set $V \in \tau_Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)\footnote{The preimage of a set $Y$ under the function $f$ is defined as $f^{-1}(Y) = \{x|f(x)\in Y\}$. Note that this has nothing to do with inverse of a function (sadly we use the same notation)} \in \tau_X$ is open in $X$.
    \item \textit{homeomorphism}: A homeomorphism is a bijective function $f: X\to Y$ between two topological spaces such that both $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are continuous. If such a function exists, we say that the two spaces are \textbf{homeomorphic} and we write $X\cong Y$.
  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Manifolds}
Let us see some pictures. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/torus.tex}
    \caption{Torus (yeah, donut came atlast!)}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/sphere.tex}
    \caption{Sphere (like yo mama)}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/plane.tex}
    \caption{A Waving Flag perhaps?}
  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{\textbf{What's common in all these?}}
\end{figure}
\noindent
So, what is common in all these pictures? Note that they all look very different from each other but if we really ZOOM in \emoji{mag-right} we can see that each of them look alike, like a \textit{flat plane}. Well, the road ahead of us looks flat but the road is on the freaking Earth which is, let's say to a physicist's satisfaction, a sphere. So, we can say that all of these things look `locally' like the flat plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. This is essentially the idea behind a \textbf{manifold}, things which look locally Euclidean. 
\subsection{Tangent Spaces}
\subsection{Differential Forms}
% \textit{Definition.} Suppose $C\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a curve and let $p\in C$ is a point. The tangent space to $C$ at $p$ is the set of all vectors tangent to $C$ at $p$ and is denoted by $T_pC$.
