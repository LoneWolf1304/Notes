\section{Bit of  Differential Geometry: Dayuum!!}
Let us look into a bit of differential geometry which is a formal way of treating this tensor thingy. We will try to be as intuitive and non-rigorous as possible (and thus increasing our chances of making a mathematician crazy!) but yeah, we will try to be rigorous enough so that I am satisfied.
\subsection{Some prior things}
Before touching manifolds, let us define what an abstract topological space is, since manifolds are special case of topological spaces. 
\begin{definition}[Topological Space]
  A topological space is a set $(X, \uptau )$ where $\uptau \subset \mathcal{P}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\emptyset, X \in \uptau$.
    \item $U_\alpha \in \uptau \implies \bigcup \limits_{\alpha\in J} U_\alpha \in \uptau$  (closed under arbitrary union).
    \item $U_i \in \uptau \implies \bigcap \limits_{i=1}^n U_i \in \uptau$  (closed under finite intersection)\footnotemark.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\footnote{Here $\alpha$ index is used when we want the indexing set $J$ (indexing set means the set from where the incides to denote the elements of the set are taken from) to be arbitrary, meaning that the set $\{U_\alpha\}$ can be finite, countable or uncountable. On the other hand, index $i$ is mostly used when the indexing set is finite.}

Well well, this does not look anything like coffee cup and donut which most people associate topology with. That is a case of \textit{homeomorphism} which will be discussed later (hopefully). However, for now let us proceed. The sets belonging to $\uptau$ are called \textbf{open sets}. We define a \textbf{closed set} as a set whose complement is open. There are umpteen other definitions like \textbf{closure, boundary, interior, neighbourhood}, etc. Let define few of them \emoji{loudly-crying-face}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Closure} of a set $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$ and is denoted by $\overline{A}$.
    \item \textit{Interior} of a set $A$ is the largest open set contained in $A$ and is denoted by $\text{int}(A)$.
    \item \textit{Boundary} of a set $A$ is the set of points which are neither in the interior nor in the exterior of $A$ and is denoted by $\partial A$.
    \item If $p\in X$, then a \textit{neighbourhood} of $p$ is a set $N$ such that there exists an open set $U\in \uptau$ with $p\in U\subseteq N$.
\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \input{plot&diagrams/neighbourhood.tex}
      \caption{Neighbourhood of a point $p$ in  $X$}
\end{figure}
          \item \textit{Hausdorff Space}: A topological space is called Hausdorff if for any two distinct points $x,y\in X$, there exist open sets $U,V\in \uptau$ such that $x\in U, y\in V$ and $U\cap V = \emptyset$. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \input{plot&diagrams/hausdorff.tex}
      \caption{A \textbf{Hausdorff Space}, where the points $x$ and $y$ are separated by the open sets $U$ and $V$.}
    \end{figure}
    \item \textit{Topological Continuity}: A function $f: X \to Y$ between two topological spaces is said to be continuous if for every open set $V \in \uptau_Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)\footnote{The preimage of a set $Y$ under the function $f$ is defined as $f^{-1}(Y) = \{x|f(x)\in Y\}$. Note that this has nothing to do with inverse of a function (sadly we use the same notation)} \in \uptau_X$ is open in $X$.
    \item \textit{Homeomorphism}: A homeomorphism is a bijective function $f: X\to Y$ between two topological spaces such that both $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are continuous. If such a function exists, we say that the two spaces are \textbf{homeomorphic} and we write $X\cong Y$.
    \item \textit{Cover:} A cover of a topological space $X$ is a collection of sets $\{U_\alpha \}$whose union is $X$ that is, $\bigcup\limits_\alpha U_\alpha = X$. If each set is an open set, then it is called an \textbf{open cover}. If there exists a finite collection of subsets of the cover such that their union is $X$, that is, $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k U_i = X$ then it is called a \textbf{finite subcover}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/opencov.tex}
    \caption{Open cover of a space}
  \end{figure}
  \item \textit{Subspace Topology }is the topology on a subset $Y\subseteq X$ induced by the topology of $X$. In this case, open sets of $Y$ are basically the intersection of open sets of $X$ with $Y$. So,
  $$\uptau_Y = \{U\cap Y| U\in \uptau_X\}$$
  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Manifolds}
Let us see some pictures. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}

    \caption{A Waving Flag perhaps?}
  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{\textbf{What's common in all these?}}
\end{figure}
\noindent
So, what is common in all these pictures? Note that they all look very different from each other but if we really ZOOM in \emoji{mag-right} we can see that each of them look alike, like a \textit{flat plane}. Well, the road ahead of us looks flat but the road is on the freaking Earth which is, let's say to a physicist's satisfaction, a sphere. So, we can say that all of these things look `locally' like the flat plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. This is essentially the idea behind a \textbf{manifold}, things which look locally Euclidean (like $\mathbb{R}^n$). Let us define manifolds formally:
\begin{definition}[Differentiable Manifold]
  $\mathcal{M}$ is a m-dimensional differentiable manifold if:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{M}$ is a topological space.
    \item There exists an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and for each $\alpha$, there exists a homeomorphism $\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \to V_\alpha$ where $V_\alpha$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$.
    \item Two open sets $U_i, U_j$ such that $U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset$, then the map $\psi_{ij} = \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ is a smooth map \footnotemark, where $\psi_{ij}: \phi_j(U_i \cap U_j) \to \phi_i(U_i \cap U_j)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\footnotetext{
A smooth map is a function which is infinitely differentiable, that is, all the derivatives exist and are continuous. Sometimes a smooth map $f$ is said to belong to the class $C^\infty$. In general, $C^k$ is the class of functions which are $k$ times continuously differentiable. \textcolor{blue}{We will consider mostly `smooth' things here, so we will always in general take $k$ to be $\infty$}}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering 
  \input{plot&diagrams/manifold.tex}
  \caption{The figure shows the third point in the definition. So basically, we note where the homeomorphisms map the intersection of the open sets and then define the map $\psi_{ij}$ between these two regions.}
\end{figure}
A point $p \in U \subset \mathcal{M}$ has the coordinates $(\phi^1(p),\ldots, \phi^m(p) )\in \mathbb{R}^m$ with respect to the chart $(U,\phi)$. The coordinate functions $\phi^i$ are defined in terms of the projection map $\mathrm{proj}_i:\mathbb{R}^m \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathrm{proj}_i(x) \mapsto x^i$\footnote{This just selects the $i^{\text{th}}$ component of a m-dimensional vector $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$} and $\phi^\mu: \mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $p \mapsto \mathrm{proj}_\mu(\phi(p))$. So basically $\phi$ sends $p$ to some point in $\mathbb{R}^m$ and then to find the individual components, we take the projection of $\phi(p)$ along that coordinate. Henceforth we will use $r^i$ to denote $\mathrm{proj}_i$ (cause brevity is the soul of wit!) and also, to be familiar with our common sense, we will denote the coordinate maps $\phi^i$ with $x^i$, which actually gives us the feel of some coordinates.\\[0.3cm]
The terminologies used here are very much related to the geography of Earth. The pair $(U_i, \phi_i)$ is called a \textit{chart} (maybe because they help us to locally ``chart'' the manifold, that is, understand it using some coordinates) and the collection of all charts is called an \textit{atlas} (well, because it is collection of maps). \\[0.3cm]
Now let us unfold this carefully. For the open set $U_i$, the map $\phi_i$ takes it to another open set in $\mathbb{R}^m$. So for all $x\in U_i$ we got a mapping to an Euclidean space. Same goes for $U_j$, that is we obtain a mapping into another copy of $\mathbb{R}^m$. Now for points in the intersection of $U_i$ and $U_j$, we have got two different mappings and we can go back and forth between the two copies of $\mathbb{R}^m$ since these mappings were homeomorphisms. This is what we had with the mapping $\psi_{ij}$ (and thus, these are aptly called \textit{transition functions}). It first maps with the inverse of $\phi_j$  and then applies $\phi_i$. The net effect is that we are mapping between a point in one copy of $\mathbb{R}^m$ to another copy of $\mathbb{R}^m$. \\[0.3cm]
Imagine the open sets as patches in the manifold. We can then patch together the whole manifold by taking the union of all the open sets, all of which can be viewed as a Euclidean space. There are also manifolds which do not have the smooth property on the transient function, only continuity is there. These are called in general \textbf{topological manifolds}.\\[0.2cm]
] We also assume that our manifolds are \textbf{Hausdorff} and paracompact (which we will not define here). 
\begin{ffact}
For a differentiable manifold $\SM$, the set of smooth real-valued functions on it $C^\infty(\SM)$ is a \textit{ring}
\end{ffact}
\subsubsection{Examples:}
Now comes the good thing: examples! \emoji{smiling-face}
\textbf{The Space $\mathbf{\mathbb{R}^n}$}\\[0.3cm]
Duh, it looks like $\mathbb{R}^n$ locally since it is $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself. A single chart is enough for the purpose and the homeomorphism is the identity map. \\[0.3cm]
\textbf{The Circle $\mathbb{S}^1$}\\[0.3cm]
Circle is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$. We mostly take $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$ but we come across a problem. Note that the open sets on a circle are basically union of ``open arcs''. However, $[0,2\pi)$ is not open. Thus we need atleast two charts to cover the circle.\\[0.3cm]
We take two antipodal points on the circle and then define the charts as follows: \\[0.3cm]
Let $U_1 = \mathbb{S}^1\backslash \{(1,0)\},U_2 = \mathbb{S}^1\backslash \{(-1,0)\}$. Then define the homeomorphisms as:
$$\phi_1: \mathbb{S}^1\backslash \{(1,0)\}\rightarrow (0,2\pi) \quad \quad \phi_2: \mathbb{S}^1\backslash \{(-1,0)\}\rightarrow (-\pi,\pi)$$
These functions basically take the value of the angle $\theta$ that a point on the circle makes with the x-axis.  
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/circchart1.tex}
    \caption{Here the point $(1,0)$ is removed and $\phi_1$ maps the rest of the circle to the interval $(0,2\pi)$.}
    \label{fig:circchart1}

  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{plot&diagrams/circchart2.tex}
    \caption{Here the point $(-1,0)$ is removed and $\phi_2$ maps the rest of the circle to the interval $(-\pi,\pi)$.}
    \label{fig:circchart2}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{$\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are invertiable and continuous (easily seen).  The two charts intersect in the upper and lower semicircles (as the antipodal points are removed). The transition function is given by:
  \(\phi_1 \circ \phi_2^{-1}(\theta) = \begin{cases}   \theta  & \text{if } \theta\in (0, \pi) \\  \theta+2\pi & \text{if } \theta \in (-\pi, 0) \end{cases}\)which is \textit{smooth} on each of the semicircles as required. Thus this is a valid chart for the circle.}  
  
\end{figure}
\noindent
The same circle can be described by another chart using the stereographic projection, resulting in the \textbf{Mercator Atlas}. For this let us consider $U_1 = \mathbb{S}\backslash(0,1)$ and $U_2 = \mathbb{S}\backslash(0,-1)$. Then what we do is, we define maps $\phi_1: U_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ ($\phi_2:U_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$) which maps a point $p\in U_1(U_2)$ to some point on the x-axis. This is called a stereographic projection.  Let us find explicit forms for these maps:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{plot&diagrams/steoreo.tex}
  \caption{Stereographic projection of the circle} 
\end{figure}
\noindent
In the above picture, the equation of the straight line for $\phi_1$ is given by:
$$\frac{y-1}{x-0} = \frac{0-y}{a-x}$$ from where we obtain $a=\frac{x}{1-y}$. Similarly, we obtain $b = \frac{x}{1+y}$. Then what we have is $(x,y) \mapsto \frac{x}{1-y}$ (we take only the x-component since y-component is always 0 and thus the codomain is a real number) for $\phi_1$ and $(x,y) \mapsto \frac{x}{1+y}$ for $\phi_2$.  Suppose we are given a point \( (t, 0) \in \mathbb{R} \times \{0\} \), and we want to compute the inverse image under the stereographic projection \( \varphi_1^{-1} \).\\[0.2cm]
We are given that \( \varphi_1(x, y) = \dfrac{x}{1 - y} = t \). Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[
x = t(1 - y)
\]
Substitute this into the unit circle equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \):
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
\implies \ t^2(1 - y)^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
\implies \ t^2(1 - 2y + y^2) + y^2 &= 1 \\
\implies \ t^2 - 2t^2 y + t^2 y^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
\implies \ (1 + t^2)y^2 - 2t^2 y + (t^2 - 1) &= 0
\end{align*}
This is a quadratic in \( y \). Solving it gives:
\[
y = \frac{2t^2 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2(1 + t^2)} = \frac{t^2 \pm 1}{t^2 + 1}
\]
So the two roots are:
\[
y = 1, \quad y = \frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1}
\]
Since \( y = 1 \) corresponds to the north pole (which is excluded from the domain of \( \varphi_1 \)), we discard it. Thus, we have:
\[
y = \frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1}
\]
Now substitute back to find \( x \):
\begin{align*}
x &= t(1 - y) = t \left(1 - \frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1} \right)
= t \left( \frac{(t^2 + 1) - (t^2 - 1)}{t^2 + 1} \right)
= t \left( \frac{2}{t^2 + 1} \right)
= \frac{2t}{t^2 + 1}
\end{align*}
Hence, the inverse map \( \varphi_1^{-1}: \mathbb{R} \to S^1 \setminus \{(0,1)\} \) is given by:
\[
\boxed{
\varphi_1^{-1}(t) = \left( \frac{2t}{1 + t^2}, \frac{t^2 - 1}{1 + t^2} \right)
}
\]
Note that this map is continuous and hence this is a homeomorphism. Similarly, we can prove it for $\phi_2$ also. Now, if we take a point from the intersection, $U_1\bigcap U_2$ (that is, the circle without the poles), then we can never obtain the point $(0,0)$ since both maps give $(0,0)$ only when one of the input is along the y-xis. Thus, $\phi_1(U_1\bigcap U_2) = \mathbb{R}\backslash 0, \phi_2(U_1\bigcap U_2) = \mathbb{R}\backslash 0$. Now let's see the transition map: 
$$\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1} = \phi_2 \brac{\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}} = \frac{\frac{2t}{t^2+1}}{\frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}-1} = \frac{2t}{2t^2} = \frac{1}{t}$$ which is smooth on $\mathbb{R}\backslash 0 $. Similarly for the other case also, we can show. Thus $\{(U_1, \varphi_1), (U_2, \varphi_2)\}$ for an atlas for the circle and is called the Mercator Atlas. 
Similarly we can prove that the $n$-dimensional sphere is a manifold. \\[0.3cm]
\textbf{Product Manifold:}\\[0.2cm]
Let $\mathcal{M}$ be an $m$-dimensional manifold with atlas $\{U_i,\varphi_i\}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold with atlas $\{V_i,\psi_i\}$, then we define the product manifold as an $(m+n)-$ dimensional manifold with atlas $\{U_i\times V_j, (\phi_i , \psi_j)\}$. So basically we took the Cartesian product of the two coordinate neighbourhoods to define the new neighbourhood and then used the ordered pair of the two homeomorphisms to define the new coordinate function. \\[0.3cm]
\textit{Example.} The torus is a product manifold of two circles, that is, $T^2 = \mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1$. Note that by our definition, it is a two $(1+1)$ dimensional manifold. We can generalise the notion of torus by taking multiple product of circles: $$T^n = \underbrace{\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1\times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^1}_n$$ 
\subsubsection{Differentiable Maps}
\begin{definition}[Differentiable Map]
  A map $f: \mathcal{M}_m \to \mathcal{N}_n$ between two manifolds is \textit{differentiable} at $p$ if for any charts $(U,\phi)$ on $\mathcal{M}$ and $(V,\psi)$ on $\mathcal{N}$ (where $p\in U$ and $f(p)\in V$), the map $$\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$
  is a smooth map, that is, the map belongs to $C^\infty$, that is, infinitely continuously differentiable. 
\end{definition}
WTH...\emoji{worried-face} what is this weird map that we want to be smooth? Let us see in more details. So, what does $f$ do? It is a map from manifold $\mathcal{M}$ to manifold $\mathcal{N}$ and it maps $p \mapsto f(p)$. So far good...Now, we know that we can obtain coordinate representations using the homeomorphisms. Let them be:
$$\phi(p) \equiv \{x^\mu\}\quad\quad\quad \psi(f(p)) \equiv \{y^\alpha\}$$
So what $\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$ does is, it takes a vector from $\mathbb{R}^m$, sends it back to the manifold $\mathcal{M}$, applies $f$ to it to send it to manifold $\mathcal{N}$ and then sends it to $\mathbb{R}^n$, so finally we obtain a $n$ element output from $m$ element input, using $f$. So this is just the usual map like what we write $\veb{y} = f(\veb{x})$. Lol, this is nothing but the differentiability of a function, albeit in a more stylish (and appropriate) way.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering 
  \input{plot&diagrams/diffmap.tex}
  \caption{Representation of a differentiable map}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Next to come to another \textit{-morphism} related to the differentiable manifolds. 
\begin{definition}[Diffeomorphism]
  Let $f: \mathcal{M}_m \rightarrow \mathcal{N}_n$ be a homeomorphism and $\psi$ and $\phi$ be the coordinate functions as defined before. If $\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is invertible and both $\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$ and its inverse $\phi\circ f^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1}$ are smooth maps, then $f$ is called a \textit{diffeomorphism}. The manifolds are then said to be diffeomorphic to each other.
\end{definition}
Well, we had earlier seen that homeomorphisms characterise spaces which can be `continuously' deformed into each other. Diffeomorphism does one thing extra, it characterises spaces which are transformed `smoothly' into each other. Evidently, a diffeomorphism is also a homeomorphism. If two spaces a diffeomorphic, then their dimensions are same, that is $\dim \mathcal{M} = \dim \mathcal{N}$\\[0.3cm]
The set of diffeomorphisms $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ is a group and is denoted by $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathcal{M})$. 
\subsubsection{Pullback of a function}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{plot&diagrams/pullback.tex}
\end{figure}
Given a smooth map $\psi:\SM \rightarrow \SN$ and $f\in C^\infty(\SN)$, the pullback of $f$ along $\psi$ is defined to be:
$$\psi^*f\equiv f\circ \psi : \SM\rightarrow \re$$
Since $f$ and $\psi$ both are smooth maps, their composition (which is a real-valued function) is too! Thus, $\psi^*$ can be thought of as a map from $C^\infty(\SN) \rightarrow C^\infty(\SM)$. Thus, it sort of `pulls back' to the original manifold from which $\psi$ was defined. \footnote{This has something to do dual space and one-forms also, apparently, which maybe seen later.} Also, note the following properties of the pullback for two functions $f,g \in C^\infty(\SN)$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\psi^*(f+g)(p) \equiv (f+g)\circ \psi(p) = f(\psi(p))+g(\psi(p)) = \psi^*f(p)+\psi^*g(p)$
  \item $\psi^*(fg)(p) = (fg)\circ \psi(p) = f(\psi(p))g(\psi(p)) = (\psi^*f(p))(\psi^*g(p))$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Curves}
\begin{definition}[Curve]
  An open curve in an $m$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is a map $\sigma:(a,b)\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$ such that $a<0<b$ ($a$ and $b$ can be $\pm \infty$ also). A closed curve is a map $\sigma:\mathbb{S}^1\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$

\end{definition}
What this means is that suppose we take $t\in (a,b)$, then $\sigma(t)$ is a point on the manifold. As $t$ is varied in the interval, the points $\sigma(t)$ kinda resembles a trajectory (which we intuitively had called a `curve' so far). We had included zero in the interval for convenience. 
\subsubsection{Vectors}
In our usual sense, we imagine vectors as straight arrows drawn from the origin but in manifolds, which is `curved', firstly, straight arrows cannot be drawn in general and secondly, there is no origin from which the arrow can be drawn. If the arrow is `small' enough we can locally obtain something like a ``vector space''. Suppose the tail of the arrow is at a point $p\in \mathcal{M}$ and the tip is at a point $p'$ which is `close' to $p$, then the vector space can be approximated by the \textit{tangent space} at the point $p$. 
\subsection{Tangent Space}
Intuitively, if we use the word tangent space, we can think of some space which contains the tangent at a point of the manifold. Like in the following diagram: 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering 
  \input{plot&diagrams/tang_sp.tex}
  \caption{A very badly made representation of a tangent space. Here a sphere is considered and from the centre of the sphere, a vector $\veb{x}$ is drawn and then, a plane is drawn which just touches the sphere at point $\veb{x}$. This constitutes the tangent plane. }
\end{figure}
\noindent
Note that since the tangent is always perpendicular to the vector $\veb{x}$, we can somewhat define the tangent space at the point $\veb{x}\in S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by: $$\mathrm{T}_{x}S^n = \{\veb{v}\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}| \veb{x}\cdot \veb{v} = 0\}$$
See an apparent problem with this: This approach depends on the sphere being embedded in a higher dimension vector space and the tangent space being a specific linear subspace of this larger space. It would be better to find some `intrinsic' definition of tangent space which does not depend on this embedding of the manifold in a higher dimensional space.\\[0.3cm]
For this, we can think of the tangent vector as a tangent to a curve on the manifold. The vector is tangent to a curve on the manifold at point $\veb{x}$. Note that this curve lies on the manifold and hence the notion of a higher-dimensional embedding is done away with. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{plot&diagrams/tang_sp_curv.tex}
\end{figure}
\noindent
However, note that, as in the above picture, many different curves can be drawn to satisfy this condition. Hence, the tangent vector can be rather thought as an equivalence class of all the curves satisfying this relation. \emoji{exploding-head}
\begin{definition}[Tangent]
  Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a manifold and $p\in \mathcal{M}$. Then two curves $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are tangent to the manifold at $p$ if:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\sigma_1(0) = \sigma_2(0) = p$
    \item Given a chart $(U,\phi)$, the two curves are tangent in the usual way, that is, 
    {\small
$$\dv{t}\brac{\phi\circ\sigma_1(t)}\Bigg|_{t=0} =\dv{t}\brac{\phi\circ\sigma_2(t)}\Bigg|_{t=0} \implies \dv{t}\brac{\phi^i\circ\sigma_1(t)}\Bigg|_{t=0} =\dv{t}\brac{\phi^i\circ\sigma_2(t)}\Bigg|_{t=0}  \ \forall i = 1,\ldots, m$$
}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{definition}
If $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are `tangent' in one system, then they are tanget in any other coordinate system local around $p$, and hence this definition is independent of any coordinates. We define the tangent vector at $p \in \mathcal{M}$ as the euivalence class of curves, that is:
$$[\sigma_i] = \{\sigma | \sigma \sim_t \sigma_i \}$$
where $\sim_t$ is the equivalence relation\footnote{It can easily be shown to be reflexive, symmetric and transitive} satisfying that two curves are tangent to the manifold. Given $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$, either $[\sigma_1]=[\sigma_2]$ or $[\sigma_1]\bigcap [\sigma_2] = \emptyset$ (either same or disjoint). Thus, the equivalence classes form a `partition' of the set of all curves. The tangent space $T_p\mathcal{M}$ to manifold $\mathcal{M}$ at point $p$, is the set of all tangent vectors at the point $p$.  

\subsubsection{Vector Space Structure on the Tangent Space}
The intuitive idea of tangent space as a plane implies that vectors can be added and multiplied with some scalar, leading to a vector space structure. We now prove that the tangent space $T_p\mathcal{M}$ also carries a structure of a real vector space. 
\begin{theorem}
  The tangent space $T_p\mathcal{M}$ carries a structure of a real vector space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Two tangent vectors and their representative curves are shown on the manifold at point $p$.}

In the above figure, we have two tangent vectors $\veb{v}_1$ and $\veb{v}_2$ at $p$ with $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ as their representative curves (that is, $\veb{v}_1 = [\sigma_1]$ and $\veb{v}_2 = [\sigma_2]$). We use a local chart $(U,\phi)$ around $p$ such that $\phi(p) = \veb{0} \in \mathbb{R}^m$.\\[0.3cm]
Consider the maps $\phi \circ \sigma_1$ and $\phi \circ \sigma_2$. Since a curve $\sigma$ maps an open interval to the manifold and the homeomorphism maps an open set in the manifold to an open set in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the above composite functions maps an open interval to an open set in $\mathbb{R}^m$.\\[0.3cm]
Now, the addition $\phi \circ \sigma_1 (t) + \phi \circ \sigma_2(t)$ is valid, since these are elements of $\mathbb{R}^m$ (actually, these are also curves in $\mathbb{R}^m$). Then we consider the map:
$$\phi^{-1}\circ (\phi \circ \sigma_1 (t) + \phi \circ \sigma_2(t))$$
which is a curve back on the manifold and passes through $p$ when $t=0$. We then define:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $v_1+v_2 :=[\phi^{-1}\circ (\phi \circ \sigma_1  + \phi \circ \sigma_2)]$
  \item $rv :=[\phi^{-1}\circ (r\phi \circ \sigma )]\ \forall \ r\in \mathbb{R}$ 
\end{enumerate}
It can then be shown that these definitions are independent of the charts and the representative curves, and using these, the tangent space can be shown to be a vector space.
\subsubsection{Tangents as derivatives}
We saw a geometric way of defining tangents using the tangent space approach. Now, we will define it algebraically. The directional derivative of a function $f$ along a tangent  vector $v$ is defined as:
$$v(f) := \dv{t}f(\sigma(t))\Bigg|_{t=0}$$
where $v = [\sigma]$. This definition helps us to view $v$ as a differential operator on the space $C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$ of real-valued functions on the manifold. 
\begin{definition}[Derivations]
  A derivation at a point $p\in\mathcal{M}$ is a map $v_p:C^\infty(\mathcal{M})\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \begin{align*}
      v_p(f+g) &= v_p(f) + v_p(g) \ \forall \ f,g\in C^\infty(\mathcal{M})\\
      v_p(rf) &= r v_p(f) \ \forall \ f \in C^\infty(\mathcal{M}), r \in \mathbb{R}
    \end{align*}
    \item $v_p(fg) = f(p)v_p(g)+ g(p)v_p(f)\ \forall \ f,g\in C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$
  \end{itemize}
  The set of all derivations at $p$ is denoted as $D_p\mathcal{M}$
\end{definition}
The first condition tells us that $v$ should be a linear map and the second condition (kind of like the product rule) is the actual thing for which we call it \textit{derivation}. We can define:
\begin{align*}
  (v_1+v_2)(f) &:=v_1(f)+v_2(f) \ \forall v_1,v_2\in D_p\SM\\
(rv)(f) &:= rv(f)
\end{align*}
Also, note that:
\begin{align*}
  (v_1+v_2)(fg) &= v_1(fg) + v_2(fg) \\
  &= fv_1(g) + gv_1(f) + fv_2(g) + gv_2(f)\\
  &=f(v_1+v_2)(g) + g(v_1+v_2)(f)
\end{align*}
This gives a natural vector space structure to the space of derivations $D_p\SM$. Note that if we try to do the same analysis for $v_p\in D_p\SM$ and $w_q\in D_q\SM$, these $v_p+w_q$ will not satisfy the product rule and then will not be a valid vector. So, vectors at different point on a manifold cannot be added \emoji{face-with-rolling-eyes}\\[0.2cm] 
We can also show that $T_p\mathcal{M}$ and $D_p\mathcal{M}$ are actually \textit{isomorphic} and thus, both approaches can be taken to describe the tangent-space structure (However, the algebraic approach is a bit problematic for infinite-dimensional space). We shall henceforth use $T_p\SM$ and $D_p\SM$ as the same.
We now define a set of derivations of a function $f$ at $p$, with the help of a local chart $(U,\phi)$ where $f\in C^\infty$ and $\phi^\mu$ are the coordinate components.
$$\brac{\pdv{x^\mu}}_p f := \pdv{r^\mu}f\circ \phi^{-1}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)}\quad \mu = 1,2,\ldots, m$$
Note that in the right hand side, the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate is well defined, but in the left hand side, even though the notation is of partial derivative, the action is not well defined since the function is defined on the manifold which doesn't have the vector space structure required for definition of partial derivatives. Sometimes we use the notation $\pdv{f}{x^\mu}$ directly. Then, using this notation and also the fact that $\phi^{-1}\circ \phi(p) = p$, we can write:

$$\brac{\pdv{f}{x^\mu}} \brac{p} = \brac{\pdv{f}{x^\mu}}\brac{\phi^{-1}\circ \phi(p)} = \pdv{r^\mu}\brac{f\circ \phi^{-1}}{\phi(p)}$$
Then we can write 
$$\brac{\pdv{f}{x^\mu}}\circ \phi^{-1} \equiv   \pdv{r^\mu}\brac{f\circ \phi^{-1}}$$
\begin{ffact}
  Tangent vector acting on a constant function is zero, that is, $v_p(c) = 0$
\end{ffact}
\textit{Proof. } Suppose we have a constant real valued function $f\equiv c\in \re$. First, note that $v_p(1) = v_p(1\cdot 1) = 1v_p(1) + 1v_p(1) = 2v_p(1)\implies v_p(1)=0$. Then we will have $v_p(c) = v_p(c\cdot 1) = c v_p(1) = 0 $
\begin{proposition}
  Suppose $(U,\phi)$ is a chart with coordinates $x^i$. Then $\pdv{x^i}{x^j} = \tensor{\delta}{^i _j}$
\end{proposition}
\textit{Proof.} From the previous result, we have:
$$\pdv{x^i}{x^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \pdv{x^i \circ x^{-1}}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \pdv{r^i\circ \phi \circ x^{-1}}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} =\pdv{r^i}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \tensor{\delta}{^i _j}$$
We just used the coordinate definition using the projection maps. \\[0.3cm]
These quantitites form a basis set for the vector space $D_p\mathcal{M}$. For that we have to check for linear independence and span of these quantitites. 
\begin{proposition}
 The set $\left\{\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p \right\}$ is linearly independent.
\end{proposition}
\textit{Proof.}  $a^i \brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p = 0\implies  a^i \brac{\pdv{x^j}{x^i}}_p \implies a^i\tensor{\delta}{^j _i} = 0 \implies a^j = 0$
\begin{proposition}
  Every $v_p\in T_p\SM$ can be written as a linear combination of $\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p$
\end{proposition}
\textit{Proof.} For the proof, we need to use the \text{Mean-Value Theorem}. For a continuously differentiable function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \re$, $\exists \ c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\implies f(b) = f(a)+ f'(c)(b-a)$.\\[0.2cm] For a multi-variable function, let $U\subset \re^n$ be an open set and $H:U\rightarrow \re$ be a continuously differentiable function. Let $\veb{a},\veb{b}\in U$ and $l(\veb{a},\veb{b})\equiv \{(1-t)\veb{a}+t\veb{b}|t\in [0,1]\}\subset U$.\\[0.2cm] Then define $h:[0,1]\rightarrow \re$ such that $t\mapsto H((1-t)\veb{a}+t\veb{b}) = H(\veb{a}+t(\veb{b}-a))$.\\[0.2cm]
Note that $h(0) = H(\veb{a}), h(1) = H(\veb{b})$ and $h$ is continuously differentiable. Also,
$$h'(t) = \dv{t} H(\veb{a}+t(\veb{b}-\veb{a})) = (b^i - a^i)\pdv{H}{r^i}\Bigg|_{a+t(b-a)}$$
Now, we can apply the MVT for $\re$ on $h$ and we have for some $t_0\in (0,1)$:
\begin{align*}
  h(1) &= h(0) + (1-0)h'(t_0)\\
\implies H(b) &= H(a) +  (b^i - a^i)\pdv{H}{r^i}\Bigg|_{a+t_0(b-a)}
\end{align*}
Now, let us begin the actual proof. So let us take a chart $(U,\phi) on \SM$ and $f\in C^\infty(\SM)$. Then $f\circ\phi^{-1}: \phi(U)\rightarrow \re$ is a smooth map.\\[0.2cm]
Let $p\in U\implies \phi(p)\in \phi(U)$. As $\phi(U)$ is open subset of $\re^m$, there exists a $r>0$ such that $\SB(\phi(p), r)\subset \phi(U)$, from the basis definition of an open set. Then, let $q\in \phi^{-1}(\SB(\phi(p), r))$. Then $\phi(p)$ and $\phi(q)$ satisfy the condition $\{(1-t)\phi(p) +t\phi(q)|t\in[0,1]\}\subset \phi(U)$. Then we can apply the mean value theorem as seen before and we have:
\begin{align*}
  f(q)-f(p) &= f\circ\phi^{-1} \circ \phi(q) - f\circ\phi^{-1} \circ \phi(p)\\
&=f\circ\phi^{-1}(x^1(q), x^2(q),\ldots,x^m(q)) - f\circ\phi^{-1}(x^1(p), x^2(p),\ldots,x^m(p))\\
&=(x^i(q)-x^i(p))\pdv{f\circ\phi^{-1}}{r^i}\Bigg|_{\phi(p) +t(\phi(q)-\phi(p))}
\end{align*}
Now, if we fix $p$, then $$\pdv{f\circ\phi^{-1}}{r^i}\Bigg|_{\phi(p) +t(\phi(q)-\phi(p))}$$ depends only on $q$ and we denote it by $g_i(q)$. This implies that $g_i(p) = \pdv{f\circ\phi^{-1}}{r^i}\Bigg|_{\phi(p)} \equiv \brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p f$. We finally have:
$$f(q)=f(p)+(x^i(q)-x^i(p))g_i(q)\implies f\equiv f(p)+(x^i-x^i(p))g_i$$
Now let us apply some tangent vector $v_p$ to $f$. We have:
\begin{align*}
  v_p(f) &= v_p(f(p)+(x^i-x^i(p))g_i)\\
  &=\cancelto{0}{v_p(f(p))}+v_p((x^i-x^i(p))g_i) \quad (\because p \text{ fixed, $f(p)$ constant})\\
  &=v_p(g_i)\cancelto{0}{(x^i-x^i(p))_p} + v_p(x^i - x^i(p))g_i(p)\\
  &=(v_p(x^i) - v_p(x^i(p)))g_i(p)\\
  &=v_p(x^i)g_i(p) \\
  &= v_p(x^i)\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p f
\end{align*}
Thus, we see that every tangent vector can be written as a combination of the set of derivations.\\[0.2cm]
So from the above two propositions, we proved that these quantities are indeed a basis for the tangent space. So any vector $v_p$ can be written as: $$v_p = c^i \brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p \implies v_p(x^j) = c^i \brac{\pdv{x^j}{x^i}}_p = c^i \tensor{\delta}{^j _i} = c^j \implies v_p = v_p(x^i) \brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p$$
We now define something which we had already seen earlier, the Jacobian. For that, let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be two manifolds and $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be two charts on these manifolds respectively and $F: \mathcal{M}\rightarrow N$ be a smooth map between the manifolds such that $F(U) \subset V$. Let $F^i$ denote the $i^{\text{th}}$ component of $F$ in chart $(V,\psi)$. Then we have:
$$F^i := \psi^i \circ F = r^i \circ \psi \circ F$$
We call the matrix $[\pdv{F^i}{x^j}]$ to be the Jacobian matrix of $F$ relative to these charts and if the two manifolds have same dimension, we can also calculate the determinant of this matrix. If the manifolds are same and we have two overlapping charts, then the transition map $\gamma = \psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ is from $\mathbb{R}^m$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$. Previously, in the definition, we had $F:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{N}$. If we take $F= \gamma$, then $\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}^m$ whose coordinates are $r^\mu$. Then
$$\pdv{\gamma^i}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \pdv{\brac{\psi \circ \phi^{-1}}^i}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} =\pdv{r^i \circ \brac{\psi \circ \phi^{-1}}}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \pdv{ \psi^i { \circ \phi^{-1}}}{r^j}\brac{\phi(p)} = \pdv{\psi^i}{\phi^j}\brac{p}$$
What this tells us is that the Jacobian matrix of the transition map is the matrix of the partial derivatives at $p$. This is very similar to what we had earlier seen, the Jacobian written as $\pdv{x'}{x}$. 

\begin{theorem}[Inverse Function Theorem]
  \textbf{For $\mathbf{\mathbb{R}^n}$}: Let $F: W\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth map where $W$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For $p\in W$, $F$ is locally invertible at $p$ iff determinant of the Jacobian matrix is not zero. \\[0.2cm]
  \textbf{For manifolds}: Let $F:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{N}$ be a smooth map between two manifolds and $p\in \mathcal{M}$. Let $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be two charts about $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively and $F(U)\subset V$. Let $F^i = \psi^i \circ F$. Then $F$ is locally invertible at $p$ iff Jacobian determinant is non-zero.
\end{theorem}
This is a local result and hence, directly translated to manifolds too from $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\subsubsection{Push-forward (differential)}
Remember the pull-back? Huh, now this is its counterpart.\\[0.2cm]
Let $\SM$ and $\SN$ be two differentiable manifolds and $\psi: \SM\rightarrow \SN$ be a smooth map. The map $\psi$ induces a map between $T_p\SM$ and $T_{\psi(p)}\SN$ denoted by $\psi_{*p}$ or $d\psi_p$ which is called the differential of $\psi$ (basically, $p \mapsto \psi(p)$ under $\psi$ and the tangent plane at $p$ is mapped to tangent plane at $\psi(p)$) using this \textit{differential}. If $v_p\in T_p\SM$, then $\psi_{*p}(v_p)\in T_{\psi(p)}\SN$ and is defined by:
$$\psi_{*p}(v_p)(f) \equiv v_p(\psi^* f)\ \forall \ f\in \cty{\SN}$$
Let us now check that $\psi_{*p}(v_p)$ is indeed a member of the tangent plane at $\psi(p)$ in $N$. 
\begin{align*}
  \psi_{*p}(v_p)(c_1f_1 + c_2f_2) &= v_p(\psi^*(c_1f_1+c_2f_2))\\
  &=v_p(c_1(\psi^*f_1) + c_2(\psi^*f_2)) \qquad\quad \text{($\psi^*$ is a linear map)}\\
  &=c_1v_p(\psi^*f_1) + c_2 v_p(\psi^*f_2) \qquad\quad \text{($v_p$ is a linear map)}\\
  &=c_1 \psi_{*p}(v_p)(f_1)+c_2 \psi_{*p}(v_p)(f_2)
\end{align*}%
\begin{align*}
  \psi_{*p}(v_p)(fg) &= v_p(\psi^*(fg))\\
  &=v_p((\psi^*f)(\psi^*g))\\
  &=(\psi^*f)v_p(\psi^*g) +(\psi^*g)v_p(\psi^*f) \qquad\qquad \text{(Liebniz rule)}\\
  &= (\psi^*f)\psi_{*p}(v_p)(g) + (\psi^*g)\psi_{*p}(v_p)(f)
\end{align*}
Now, let us check that $\psi_{*p}$ is a linear map from $T_p\SM \rightarrow T_{\psi(p)}\SN$. For that, consider a linear combination of vectors from the tangent space of $\SM$. 
\begin{align*}
  \psi_{*p}(c_1 v_{p}+c_2 w_p)(f) &=(c_1 v_{p}+c_2 w_p)(\psi^* f)\\
&=c_1v_p(\psi^*f) + c_2w_p(\psi^*f)\\
&=c_1 \psi_{*p}(v_p)(f)+c_2 \psi_{*p}(w_p)(f)
\end{align*}
Thus, we proved the linearity of the push-forward. Now using this differential, we will obtain an expression which is analogous to the Jacobian seen earlier. For that, take charts $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\chi)$ on $\SM$ and $\SN$ respectively, with coordinate functions $(x^1, x^2,\ldots, x^m)$ and $(y^1, y^2,\ldots, y^n)$ and $\psi: \SM\rightarrow \SN$ and consider $\psi_{*p}\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p \in T_{\psi(p)}\SN$. 
\begin{align*}
  \psi_{*p}\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p &=  \psi_{*p}\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p\brac{y^j}\brac{\pdv{y^j}}_{\psi(p)}\quad\quad \text{(expanding with basis elements)}\\
  &=\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p(\psi^* y^j)\brac{\pdv{y^j}}_{\psi(p)}\\
  &=\brac{\pdv{x^i}}_p(y^j\circ \psi)\brac{\pdv{y^j}}_{\psi(p)}\\
  &=\brac{\pdv{(y^j\circ \psi)}{x^i}}_p\brac{\pdv{y^j}}_{\psi(p)}
\end{align*}  
This looks very similar to the Jacobian thingy that we saw earlier and thus, push-forward is also kind of like the Jacobian matrix.\\[0.3cm]
\textbf{Pushing tangents to curves:}\\[0.2cm]
Let $\psi: \SM\rightarrow \SN$ and $\sigma: (a,b)\rightarrow \SM$ be a curve on $\SM$. Then $\psi\circ \sigma: (a,b)\rightarrow \SN$ is a curve on $\SN$. Then tangent vector $v$ to this curve at $(\psi\circ \sigma)(0)$ satisfies for any $f\in \cty{\SN}$: 
$$v(f) = \dv{t}f\circ (\psi\circ \sigma)\Bigg|_{t=0}$$
Now, these can be alternatively written as: 
$$v(f) = \dv{t} (\psi\circ \sigma)^* f\Bigg|_{t=0} = \dv{t}\sigma^*(f\circ \psi)\Bigg|_{t=0} =\dv{t}(f\circ \psi)\circ \sigma\Bigg|_{t=0} = w(f\circ\psi)$$
where $w$ is the tangent vector to the curve at $\sigma(0)$, acting on the function $f\circ\psi$ which can also be written as $w(\psi^*f)$. Using the definition of push-forward, this is nothing but $\psi_{*\sigma(0)}(w)(f)$\\
Now, since this is true for any smooth function $f$, we can write $v\equiv \psi_{*\sigma(0)}(w)$. In other words, the Jacobian of $\psi$ pushes the tangent vectors of $\sigma$ to tangent vectors of the image of $\sigma$ under $\psi$.

\subsection{Vector Fields}
\begin{definition}[Vector Field]
  A vector field $X$ on a smooth manifold is a map from $\SM \rightarrow T\SM$ with $\pi\circ X = \mathrm{id}_\SM$, which assigns a tangent vector $X_p\in T_p\mathcal{M}$ at each point $p\in \mathcal{M}$.
\end{definition}
$X$ takes a point $p$ from $\SM$ and assigns a tangent vector $X_p$ to the point. Now, if we apply the canonical projection $\pi$, then we obtain $p$ back.\\[0.2cm]
As specified earlier, a vector field is a section of the tangent bundle. A vector field is smooth if the map $X: \mathcal{M}\rightarrow T\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth section of the tangent bundle. We will focus mostly on smooth vector fields only. Since a vector field assigns a tangent vector to each point of its domain and the tangent vector (from algebraic approach) maps differentiable functions to real numbers, we can define a map $\veb{X}f$ from $\mathcal{M}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ as: 
$$(\veb{X}f)(p) \equiv\veb{X}_p[f]$$
From this, we can define the map $X: C^\infty(\SM) \rightarrow C^\infty(\SM)$ such that $f\mapsto Xf$. This gives us another interpretation of a vector field as a \textit{``map from smooth functions to smooth functions''}. The image $Xf$ is often called the \textit{Lie derivative} of $f$ along the vector field $X$, denoted by $\SL$. 
Then, from the definition of derivations, we have the following:
$$\veb{X}(af+bg)=a\veb{X}f + b\veb{X}g \quad \quad \veb{X}(fg) = f\veb{X}g + g\veb{X}f\quad \forall \ f,g \in C^\infty(\mathcal{M}) \ \ \text{and}\ \ a,b\in\mathbb{R}$$
We also have stated that $\brac{\pdv{x^i}}$ form a basis for the tangent space (or space of derivation which is isomorphic to the tangent space, so we treat them as the 'same')\\[0.3cm]
The set of all vector fields $\mathfrak{X}(\SM)$ on a manifold carries a structure of a real vector space, that is:
$$(aX+bY)f := aXf + bYf \ \forall \ f \in C^\infty(\SM)$$
This definition can be extended to give $\mathfrak{X}(\SM)$ a \textit{module} structure over the ring $C^\infty(\SM)$. Thus, if $g,h \in C^\infty(\SM)$ and $X,Y\in \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$, then:
$$(gX+hY)_p f:= g(p)X_pf + h(p)Y_pf\ \forall p\in\SM, f \in C^\infty(\SM)$$
\subsubsection{Coordinate Basis Vector Field}
If $(U,\phi)$ is a chart on the manifold $\SM$ with coordinate functions $(x^1,\ldotp,x^n)$, then we can naturally define $n$ vector fields $\qty(\pdv{x^i})$ defined by:
$$\qty(\pdv{x^i})(p) := \qty(\pdv{x^i})_p$$
The RHS is just the tangent vector to the $i^{\text{th}}$ coordinate cuve passing through $p$. Now, using the previous definitions, for any function $f\in \cty{\SM}$,
\begin{align*}
  \qty(\pdv{x^i}f)(p) = \pdv{x^i}_p [f] = \pdv{r^i}(f\circ \phi^{-1})(\phi(p)) = \qty( \pdv{r^i}(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi)(p)
\end{align*}
Thus from here we obtain:
$$ \pdv{x^i}f = \pdv{r^i}(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi$$
This is something which is good tbh, this tell us that the ``partial derivative'' of a function defined on the manifold is just the partial derivative of the ``proxy function'' $f\circ \phi^{-1}$ composed with $\phi$.\\[0.2cm]
Now, since $\qty(\pdv{x^i})_p$ form a basis of the tangent space, for any vector field $X$, we can write:
\begin{align*}
  X(p) \equiv X_p = X^i(p)\qty(\pdv{x^i})(p) = \qty(X^i \pdv{x^i})(p)
\end{align*} 
Since $p$ is any arbitrary point on the manifold, we have:
$$X  = \qty(X^i \pdv{x^i})$$
Note that the vector field $X$ has an expansion which is very similar to a tangent vector but there, the coefficients were real numbers while here, the coefficients are functions and the basis vectors here are vector fields and not tangent vectors. To find the expression of the function $X^i$ note that,
$$(Xx^i)(p) = X_p[x^i] = X^j(p)\qty(\pdv{x^j})(p)[x^i] = X^j(p)\tensor{\delta}{^i_j} = X^i(p)$$
Now, from here we have the nice expression that $X^i = Xx^i$. Let us see the nicest thing to ever come, which provides some kind of redemption to all these ``mind-hurting'' mathematical juggleries:\\[0.2cm]
If $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\chi)$ be two chart of manifold $\SM$ and if the coordinate functions are $\qty(x^1, x^2,\ldots,x^n)$ and $\qty(x'^1, x'^2,\ldots,x'^n)$ respectively, then for $X\in \mathfrak{X}$:
$$X'^i = Xx'^i = X^j \qty(\pdv{x^j})x'^i = X^j \qty(\pdv{x'^i}{x^j})$$
Damn, the sanctimonious transformation rule is obtained as a result of these intricate definitons!! Idk, but this really made my day...\\[0.3cm]
\textbf{Example:} Let $\SM = \re^2$ and consider two charts:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(U,\phi) = (\SM, \mathrm{id})$ with coordinate function $x,y$
\item $(V,\chi)$  where $V = \re^2 \backslash \{(x,y)| x\leq 0, y=0\}$ and $\chi$ is such that $p \mapsto (r,\theta)$.The origin had to be taken out anyways since at zero, the value of $\theta$ is not well-defined. The transformations are:
$$x=r\cos\theta \qquad\qquad y = r\sin\theta$$
$$r= \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\qquad\qquad \theta(p) = \int\limits_{\SC} \frac{xdy-ydx}{x^2+y^2}$$
Here, $\SC$ is a curve joining $(1,0)$ to point $p$. We took this form of $\theta$ instead of the usual $\tan^{-1}\qty(\frac{y}{x})$ since it is not really well-defined at $x=0$.
\end{itemize} 
Now, if ${X}$ has components $2xy$ and $(1-x^2+y^2)$ in the basis $\qty{\pdv{x},\pdv{y}}$, then what are components in the basis $\qty{\pdv{r},\pdv{\theta}}$\\[0.2cm]
Note that $\qty{\pdv{x},\pdv{y}}$ is not the partial derivative. These are vector fields. We can write $$X = 2xy\pdv{x} + (1-x^2+y^2)\pdv{y}$$. Now, we have:
$$Xr =2xy\pdv{r}{x} + (1-x^2+y^2)\pdv{r}{y} $$
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \input{plot&diagrams/coordtrans_diag.tex}
  \caption{How we defined $\theta$. Note that a small change in the integrand is exactly equal to $d\theta$ and then when we integrate, we get our value of $\theta_p$. }
\end{figure}
Calculating the above expression, we will obtain $Xr = (1+r^2)\sin\theta$. Similarly, we have $$X\theta =2xy\pdv{\theta}{x} + (1-x^2+y^2)\pdv{\theta}{y} $$
Now, from the integral definition of $\theta$, we have $\pdv{\theta}{x} = -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}, \pdv{\theta}{y} = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}$. Then, evaluating the expression would give $X\theta = \frac{1-r^2}{r}\cos\theta$. Then,
$$X = X^r \pdv{r} + X^\theta \pdv{\theta} = Xr \pdv{r} + X\theta \pdv{\theta} = \mathcolor{blue}{(1+r^2)\sin\theta} \pdv{r}+\mathcolor{blue}{\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta}\pdv{\theta}$$
\begin{ffact}
$$\hat{r} = \pdv{r}  \quad\quad\quad \hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{r}\pdv{\theta}$$ 
\end{ffact}

\subsubsection{Lie stuffs (it's pronounced lee)}
We will now see when `multiplying' two vector fields will yield another field (The multiplication of two fields is intuitively defined as their composition, that is, $(X\circ Y)f = X(Yf)$). For this, note that the linearity property of vector field is easily satisfied by $X\circ Y$ but the main problem is the \textit{product rule}:
\begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
  X \circ Y (fg) &= X(fYg + gYf) \\
                 &= X(fYg) + X(gYf) \\
                 &= XgYf + gXYf + XfYg + fXYg
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
  Y \circ X (fg) &= Y(fXg + gXf) \\
                 &= Y(fXg) + Y(gXf) \\
                 &= YgXf + gYXf + YfXg + fYXg
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
Note that on its own these two quantities are not vector fields, since these do not satisfy the `product rule', however, if we subtract these quantities, we get:
  \begin{align*}
    (X\circ Y - Y\circ X)(fg) &=\cancel{XgYf} + gXYf + \cancel{XfYg} + fXYg - (\cancel{YgXf} + gYXf + \cancel{YfXg} + fYXg)\\
    &= f(X\circ Y - Y\circ X)g +g(X\circ Y - Y\circ X)f
  \end{align*}
  This difference satisfies the product rule and is a vector field. So we define a new operation on $\mathfrak{X}(\SM)$.
\begin{definition}[Lie Bracket]
  The Lie Bracket of two vector fields $X,Y$ on $\mathcal{M}$ is defined by:
  $$[X,Y]f = X(Yf) - Y(Xf) \quad \forall f\in C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$$
\end{definition}
The Lie Bracket trivially satisifes lineartiy, that is,
$$\comtr{X}{Y}(af+bg) = a \comtr{X}{Y}f + b \comtr{X}{Y}g$$
And as seen above, it also satisfies the product rule, that is,
$$\comtr{X}{Y}(fg) = f\comtr{X}{Y}g + g\comtr{X}{Y}f$$
Thus, using this definition of Lie Bracket, we can say that if $X,Y\in \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$ and $f\in \cty{\SM}$ then $\comtr{X}{Y}\in \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$. Note that, then $\comtr{\cdot\ }{\cdot }:\mathfrak{X}(\SM)\times \mathfrak{X}(\SM)\rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$ is a binary operation. Hence, using the Lie Bracket, we can define an \textit{algebra} \footnote{It is a non-associative algebra} satisfying the bilinear property:
\begin{align*}
 \comtr{aX+bY}{Z}f &= (aX+bY)(Zf) - Z(aX+bY)f\\
 &=aX(Zf)+bY(Zf) - aZ(Xf)-bZ(Yf)\\
 &=a(XZ-ZX)(f) + b (YZ-ZY)(f)\\
 &=(a\comtr{X,Z} + b\comtr{YZ})(f)
\end{align*}
As $f$ is arbitrary, we get $\comtr{aX+bY}{Z} = a\comtr{X}{Z}+b\comtr{Y}{Z}$. The linearity of the second factor can be similarly shown. Thus it is a valid algebra, called the \textit{Lie Algebra}. We can also check that $\comtr{X}{Y}f = -\comtr{Y}{X}f \implies \comtr{X}{Y} = -\comtr{Y}{X} $, hence it is an \textit{anti-commutative} algebra.\\[0.2cm]
While associativity of the Lie Bracket does not hold, we have another property, where given three vectors fields $X,Y,Z$, if we perform the Lie Bracket using a cyclic permutation, we get:
\begin{align*}
  &(\comtr{X}{\comtr{Y}{Z}}+ \comtr{Z}{\comtr{X}{Y}}+ \comtr{Y}{\comtr{Z}{X}})(f)\\
&= X\comtr{Y}{Z}f -\comtr{Y}{Z}Xf + Z\comtr{X}{Y}f - \comtr{X}{Y}Zf + Y\comtr{Z}{X}f-\comtr{Z}{X}Yf\\
&=\mathcolor{red}{(XYZ)f}-\mathcolor{blue}{(XZY)f}-\mathcolor{OliveGreen}{(YZX)f}+\mathcolor{cyan}{(ZYX)f} + \mathcolor{magenta}{(ZXY)f}-\mathcolor{cyan}{(ZYX)f} - \mathcolor{red}{(XYZ)f}\\ &\quad \quad +\mathcolor{brown}{(YXZ)f} + \mathcolor{OliveGreen}{(YZX)f} - \mathcolor{brown}{(YXZ)f}-\mathcolor{magenta}{(ZXY)f}+\mathcolor{blue}{(XZY)f }\\
&=0
\end{align*} 
Thus, we have an important property, $(\comtr{X}{\comtr{Y}{Z}}+ \comtr{Z}{\comtr{X}{Y}}+ \comtr{Y}{\comtr{Z}{X}})=0$, which is often termed as the \textit{Jacobi property}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:lie}
  Let $X,Y\in \mathfrak{\SM}$ be two vector fields and $f,g$\in $\cty{\SM}$ be two smooth functions. Then we have,
  $$\comtr{fX}{gY} = fg\comtr{X}{Y} +f(Xg)Y- g(Yf)X$$
\end{lemma}
\textit{Proof.} Let us take $h\in \cty{\SM}$. Then, 
\begin{align*}
  \comtr{fX}{gY}h &=fX(gYh) - gY(fXh)\\
  &=f((Xg)(Yh) + gX(Yh)) - g ((Yf)(Xh) + fY(Xh))\\
  &=fg (XYh -YXh) + f(Xg)Yh -g(Yf)Xh \\
  &=(fg \comtr{X}{Y} + f(Xg)Y -g(Yf)X)h
\end{align*}
Since $h$ is any arbitrary smooth function, we proved the lemma.\\[0.2cm]
We now that any vector field can be expanded in terms of $\pdv{x^i}$ and thus, it becomes kinda imperative to calculated the Lie Bracket of these quantitites. Note:
$$\comtr{\pdv{x^i}}{\pdv{x^j}}f =\pdv{x^i}\qty(\pdv{x^j})f - \pdv{x^j}\qty(\pdv{x^i})f $$ 
At the first glance, this seems to be zero (and it actually is). However, we have to be careful that these quantities are not the partial derivatives of $f$ since $f$ is a function on the manifold where partial derivatives are not defined. Instead we had earlier seen:
$$\pdv{f}{x^i} = \pdv{r^i}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi$$
Using this notation, we have:
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{x^i}\pdv{f}{x^j} = \pdv{x^i}\qty(\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi)
\end{align*}
Now, let us take $T_j = {\qty(\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi)}$, then we have:
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{T_j}{x^i} &= \pdv{r^i}\qty({T_j}\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi\\
  &= \pdv{r^i}\qty(\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \mathcolor{blue}{\phi\circ \phi^{-1}})\circ\phi\\
  &= \pdv{r^i}\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ\phi
\end{align*}
Note that in the above, it is indeed the partial derivative since $f\circ \phi^{-1}$ is a function on $\re^n$.
\begin{align*}
  \comtr{\pdv{x^i}}{\pdv{x^j}}f  &= \pdv{x^i}\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})\circ \phi - \pdv{x^j}\pdv{r^i}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1}\circ \phi)\\
  &=\qty(\pdv{x^i}\pdv{r^j}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1})-\pdv{x^j}\pdv{r^i}\qty(f\circ \phi^{-1}))\circ \phi
\end{align*}
Now, since partial derivatives commute, we can safely say that the Lie Bracket is zero \emoji{smile}, that is,
$$\comtr{\pdv{x^i}}{\pdv{x^j}} = 0$$ Now, using Lemma \ref{lemma:lie}, taking $f=X^i$ and $g = Y^j$, we can write:
\begin{align*}
  \comtr{X}{Y} &= \comtr{X^i \pdv{x^i}}{ Y^j \pdv{x^j}}\\
&=X^i Y^j \cancelto{0}{\comtr{\pdv{x^i}}{\pdv{x^j}}}+X^i\pdv{Y^j}{x^i}\pdv{x^j} - Y^j\pdv{X^i}{x^j}\pdv{x^i}\\
&=\qty(\mathcolor{red}{X^j}\frac{\mathcolor{red}{\partial} Y^i}{\mathcolor{red}{\partial x^j}}- \mathcolor{blue}{Y^j}\frac{\mathcolor{blue}{\partial} X^i}{\mathcolor{blue}{\partial x^j}})\mathcolor{OliveGreen}{\pdv{x^i}}\\
&=\qty(XY^i - YX^i)\pdv{x^i}
\end{align*}
Here comes an example,  let us take the following vector fields: 
\begin{align*}
  X &= (1+r^2)\sin\theta\pdv{r} + \qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta\pdv{\theta}\\
Y&=-(1+r^2)\cos\theta\pdv{r} +\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\sin\theta\pdv{\theta}\\
Z&=\pdv{\theta}
\end{align*}

While we can calculate the components of the Lie Bracket using the above equation, but that would be too much to handle, since we have to calculate the coefficient and then act the vector field on it for each component. Instead, we will use the fact that the component of any vector field is simply given by the vector field acting on the coordinate. Thus, we will have,
\begin{align*}
  \text{r component: }\quad  \comtr{X}{Y}r &=  X(Yr) - Y(Xr) = X\qty(-(1+r^2)\cos\theta- 0 )- Y\qty((1+r^2)\sin\theta+0)\\
  &=-\qty((1+r^2)\sin\theta\pdv{r} + \qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta\pdv{\theta})(1+r^2)\cos\theta \\&\quad -\qty(-(1+r^2)\cos\theta\pdv{r} +\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\sin\theta\pdv{\theta})(1+r^2)\sin\theta\\
  &=-2r(1+r^2)\sin\theta \cos\theta+\frac{1-r^4}{r}\cos\theta\sin\theta\\&\qquad+ 2r(1+r^2)\sin\theta\cos\theta - \frac{1-r^4}{r}\sin\theta\cos\theta\\
  &=0 \\
  \text{$\theta$ component: } \quad  \comtr{X}{Y}\theta &=  X(Y\theta) - Y(X\theta) = X\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\sin\theta - Y\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta\\
  &=\qty((1+r^2)\sin\theta\pdv{r} + \qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta\pdv{\theta})\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\sin\theta\\
  &\qquad - \qty(-(1+r^2)\cos\theta\pdv{r} +\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\sin\theta\pdv{\theta})\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})\cos\theta\\
  &=2(\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta)\qty[(1+r^2) \pdv{r}\qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r}) - \qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})^2]\\
  &=2(1+r^2)\qty(-\frac{1}{r^2}-1) - \qty(\frac{1-r^2}{r})^2\\
  &= -2\qty(\frac{1-r^4 - (1-r^2)^2}{r^2})\\
  &=-4
\end{align*}
Since we obtained the components, we can finally write:
$$\comtr{X}{Y} = 0 \times \pdv{r} -4 \times \pdv{\theta} = -4\times\pdv{\theta} = -4Z$$
Similarly if calculated, we will see:
$$\comtr{Y}{Z} = -X \qquad\qquad \comtr{Z}{Y}=-Y$$
% \begin{definition}[Lie Group]

% \end{definition}
\subsubsection{Giving vector fields a push!}
We had earlier seen the push-forward of a tangent vector. Now, the question remains is whether vector fields can be pushed too in a similar way, that is, if we start with a vector field $X$ on $\SM$, do we get a vector field on $\SN$ using $\{\psi_{*p}Y_p\}_{p\in \SM}$. There lies a problem here.\emoji{cry} \\[0.2cm] Remember that the push-forward basically mapped the tangent vector at one point to the tangent vector at another point of the other manifold. So, suppose our function $\psi:\SM\rightarrow\SN$ is not injective, hence $\exists \ p\neq q \in \SM$ such that $\psi(p)=\psi(q)$ (both mapped to same point in $\SN$).\\[0.2cm] If $X$ is a vector field on $\SM$, then it is possible that the tangent vector $X_p$ and $X_q$ might not be mapped to the same tangent vector using the push-forward, that is, $\psi_{*p} X_p \neq \psi_{*q}X_q$. Since vector field at point $\psi(p)$ assigns only one tangent vector to the point, there is an ambiguity to which of the tangent vector be assigned to $\psi(p)$.\\[0.2cm]
\begin{definition}
  Let $\psi:\SM\rightarrow\SN$ be a differentiable map and $X\in\mathfrak{X}(\SM),Y\in\mathfrak{X}(\SN)$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are \textit{$\psi$-related} if,
  $$Y_{\psi(p)} = \psi_{*p}X_p\qquad \forall\ p\in\SM$$
\end{definition}
So, the previous problem is circumvented since $\psi(p)=\psi(q)$ and hence $Y$ assigns the same vector to the point. 
\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:psirel}
  $X$ and $Y$ are $\psi$-related iff $\psi^*(Y(f)) = X(\psi^*f)$ for all $f\in\cty{\SN}$ 
\end{proposition}
\textit{Proof.}Let $p\in \SM$. Then, $$(Yf)(\psi(p)) = Y_{\psi(p)}[f] = \psi_{*p}X_p[f] = X_p[\psi^*f] = X(\psi^*f)(p)$$
\begin{theorem}
  If $\psi:\SM\rightarrow \SN$ is a diffeomorphism, then for any $X\in \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$, there exists a unique $Y\in \SN$ such that $X$ and $Y$ are $\psi$-related. We denote this smooth vector field as $\psi_*X$ and call it the \textit{push-forward } of $X$ by $\psi$.
\end{theorem}
\textit{Proof.} Let $q\in \SN$. As $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism, it is invertible and thus there exists a unique $p\in \SM$ such that $\psi(p) = q$. Then define,
$$Y_q :=\psi_{*p}X_p$$
Then $Y$ is a well-defined vector field since $\psi$ is both injective and surjective. To check smoothness of $Y$, consider a chart $(U,\phi)$ on $\SM$ with coordinate functions $(x^1,\ldots,x^n)$. As $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism, then $(F(U), \phi\circ\psi^{-1})$ is a valid chart on $\SN$, with coordinate functions say, $(y^1,\ldots,y^n)$ (since it is diffeomorphism, the dimensions of both the manifold are same).\\[0.2cm]
Then we can expand the tangent vector at $p$ using the basis and then apply the push-forward:
$$X_p = X_p(x^i)\pdv{x^i}\Bigg|_p \implies \psi_{*p}X_p =  X_p(x^i)\psi_{*p}\qty(\pdv{x^i}\Bigg|_p)=Y_q$$
Now, the push-forward is a tangent vector at $q$ and hence can be expanded using the basis in the following way:
$$\psi_{*p}\qty(\pdv{x^i}\Bigg|_p) = b^j \pdv{y^j}\Bigg|_q$$
where the coeffients are $b^j := \psi_{*p}\qty(\pdv{x^i}\Big|_p)(y^j) = \pdv{x^i}\Big|_p (\psi^*y^j) =\qty(\pdv{x^i} (\psi^*y^j))(p)$
Then, using this we can write the final expression for $Y_q$ to be:
$$Y_q = \qty[X_p(x^i)\qty(\pdv{x^i} (\psi^*y^j))(p)]\pdv{y^j}\Bigg|_q$$
The coefficient is a smooth map since $X_p(x^i)$ is smooth, as $X$ is smooth and $\pdv{x^i} (\psi^*y^j)$ is smooth since $\psi^*y^j = y^j\circ \psi$, that is, the `proxy' function, is a smooth map and hence proved.\\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Example:}\\[0.2cm]
% Let $\mathbb{D} \equiv \{(x,y)\in \re^2|x^2+y^2<1\}$ (this is an open disc) and $\psi:\mathbb{D}\rightarrow \re^3$ be the differentiable map given by:
% $$\psi^*_x = \frac{2x}{1-x^2-y^2}\qquad \psi^*_y = \frac{2y}{1-x^2-y^2}\qquad \psi^*_z = \frac{1+x^2+y^2}{1-x^2-y^2}$$
% These are the coordinates of $\psi^*$ when it acts on a point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{D}$. Now, consider a vector field on $\mathbb{D}$:
% $$V = \frac{1}{2}(1-x^2+y^2)\pdv{x} -xy\pdv{y}$$ \textcolor{red}{finish finding the push-fowards, very bad algebra...to be done later (lec 16)}
Let $p\in \SM$ and $v_p$ be the tangent vector at $p$. We will consider the bundle chart where the homeomorphism was defined by:
$$\bar{\phi}(v_p)\equiv \brac{x^1(p), x^2(p),\ldots,x^n(p),v_p[x^1], v_p[x^2],\ldots,v_p[x^n]}$$ 
Then for $f\in \cty{\SM}$, we have:
\begin{align*}
  \pi_{*v}\qty(\pdv{x^i})_v[f] = \qty(\pdv{x^i})_v[\pi^*f] = \qty(\pdv{x^i})_v[f\circ\pi]
\end{align*}
Now, $f\circ\pi$ is a function on the manifold and then we define the partial derivative:
\begin{align*}
   \pi_{*v}\qty(\pdv{x^i})_v[f] &= \lim\limits_{t\rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{t}\Big[(f\circ \pi)\circ\bar{\phi}^{-1}\brac{x^1(p),\ldots, x^i(p)+t,\ldots,x^n(p),v_p[x^1], v_p[x^2],\ldots,v_p[x^n]}\\&\qquad\qquad-(f\circ \pi)\circ\bar{\phi}^{-1}\brac{x^1(p),\ldots, x^i(p),\ldots,x^n(p),v_p[x^1], v_p[x^2],\ldots,v_p[x^n]} \Big]
\end{align*}
Now, note that,
$$(f\circ \pi)\circ\bar{\phi}^{-1} = (f\circ \phi^{-1})(\phi \circ \pi\circ\bar{\phi}^{-1})$$
Let us decode this step by step: as seen earlier, $\bar{\phi}^{-1}$ takes the $2n$-dimensional vector and returns the original tangent vector. Then $\pi$ will act on the tangent vector and then map it back to the point on the manifold. Then $\phi$ will map it to a vector in $\re^n$ with coordinate functions as the component. So essentially, the above line means that $f\circ \phi^{-1}$ acts on the vector in $\re^n$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
   \pi_{*v}\qty(\pdv{x^i})_v[f] &= \lim\limits_{t\rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{t}\Big[(f\circ \phi)\brac{x^1(p),\ldots, x^i(p)+t,\ldots,x^n(p)}\\&\quad\qquad-(f\circ \phi)\brac{x^1(p),\ldots, x^i(p),\ldots,x^n(p)} \Big]\\
   &=\qty(\pdv{x^i})_p[f]
\end{align*}
Thus, from here we obtain that $\pdv{q^i}$ and $\pdv{x^i}$ are $\pi-$related, that is,
$$ \pi_{*v}\qty(\pdv{x^i})_v = \qty(\pdv{x^i})_p$$
\subsubsection{Connection with Lie Brackets}
Let $\psi:\SM\rightarrow\SN$ and let $X_1,X_2\in \mathfrak{X}(\SM)$ and $Y_1,Y_2\in \mathfrak{X}(\SN)$ be $\psi$-related respectively. Then using the previous proposition, we have, for any $f\in \cty{\SN}$
\begin{align*}
  (Y_1f)\circ \psi = X_1(f\circ\psi)\\
  (Y_2f)\circ \psi = X_2(f\circ\psi)
\end{align*}
Let us calculate what happens with the Lie Bracket:
\begin{align*}
  \qty(\comtr{Y_1}{Y_2}f)\circ\psi &= \qty(Y_1(Y_2f)-Y_2(Y_1f))\circ\psi\\
&=(Y_1(Y_2f))\circ\psi - (Y_2(Y_1f))\circ\psi\\
&=X_1(Y_2f \circ \psi) - X_2(Y_1f\circ\psi)\quad\text{\because $Y_2f, Y_1f\in \cty{\SN}$ }\\
&=X_1(X_2(f\circ \psi)) - X_2(X_1(f\circ \psi))\\
&=\comtr{X_1}{X_2}(f\circ\psi)
\end{align*}
Thus we see that $\comtr{X_1}{X_2}$ and $\comtr{Y_1}{Y_2}$ are $\psi$ related.

\subsection{Riemannian Geometry}
Okay, so whatever BS we had been seeing earlier (I admit, I got a bit carried away with diff geo part since it was so interesting), we will now use that to see our previous discussions on tensors in a more stronger form. We will re-discuss metrics, connections, covariant derivatives, etc. but now in a more sophisticated language (which goes against my initial intentions).
