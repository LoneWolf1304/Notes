\section{Curvature: coz being flat is boring!}
Let us start with the normal meaning of curvature. For a one dimensional curve, to actually see it is `curved', we need to visualise it in two dimension. Similarly, for two dimensional surface, to see its curvature, we need to embed it in three dimensional space. So, for an $n$ dimensional space, the curvature properties which require it to be embedded in a $n+1$ dimensions is called \textit{extrinsic curvature}.\\[0.3cm]
Now, imagine a 2D creature (someone from \textit{Flatland} perhaps) whose entirely life revolves in a 2D space, who doesn't have a taste for any other dimensions, how can that being say whether it is living in a flat space or curved space? One thing it can do is, it can just join three points with shortest distance lines and then measure the sum of the internal angles of the triangle. If they do not sum to $180^\circ$, then it is not a flatland. This is called \text{intrinsic curvature} property, since we are not leaving the space.
