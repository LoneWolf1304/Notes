\section{Introduction:}
Hehe......\emoji{sweat-smile} I am writing this as a way to understand tensors better and also to do something ``productive''. I don't know how much I will be able to complete but I intend to touch upon the basic aspects, albeit, in an extremely non-rigorous way....not going into heavy math (which I think is very bad 'coz math is great \emoji{winking-face}). I will try to do some proofs (which I feel like doing) and skip others (since I don't care). I will definitely take $c=1$ unless its necessary not to. I will use the convention $(+,-,-,-)$ for the metric tensor. I will also use some gen alpha slangs (which will indicate how chill I am!) and overall try to write in a fun way. A few references which I will use are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Tensor Calculus for Physics: A Concise Guide
} by Dwight E Neuenschwander
\item \textit{The Poor Manâ€™s Introduction to Tensors} by Justin C. Feng
\item Tensor Calculus YouTube video series by eigenchris and Andrew Dotson
\end{itemize}
I will continue to add the resources as I progress. I am writing this as my own personal notes and if it helps anyone else, I will be super happy. If any mistake is there, let me know! \emoji{victory-hand}
