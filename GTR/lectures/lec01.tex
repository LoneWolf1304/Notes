In the physical sense, the word `relativity' can be used to relate the measurement of one observer with that of another, for the same object/quantity. So using relativity, we can characterise the difference in the observations of two observers in two different frame of reference. \\[0.2cm]
Note that, physical laws should not matter based on who is observing (that is, physical laws are \textit{universal}), hence \underline{relativity} becomes very important when dealing with the resolution of conflicts.\\[0.2cm]
Let us consider two reference frames, and let $v$ be the relative velocity between the frames.

    \label{fig:frame}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:frame} shows two reference frames. The moving frame is denoted by $O'$ (henceforth, primes will generally denote moving frames). If the relative velocity $v$ between the two frames remain constant, then it falls under the domain of \textit{Special Relativity} and if unfortunately (or fortunately) it doesn't, then it comes under \textit{General Relativity}. \\[0.2cm]

The theory of relativity dates back to the inception of Newtonian mechanics and hence, let us review the laws in brief (without being much technical \emoji{sweat-smile}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The First Law} $:\approx$ velocity of a body remains constant unless acted by an external, unbalanced force. 
    \item \textbf{The Second Law} $:\approx$ $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ where $\vec{F}$ is the external force and $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration. 
    \item \textbf{The Third Law} $:\approx$  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Note that for this, two bodies are needed.  
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \input{pics/third.tex}
    \end{figure}
    From the figure above, we will have $\vec{F}_{21} = -\vec{F}_{12}$
    \item \textbf{The Gravitational Law} $:\approx$ 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering 
        \input{pics/newt_grav.tex}
    \end{figure}
    \noindent
    In the above situation, $$\vec{F} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{\rcurs^2}\hat{\rcurs}$$
\end{itemize}
\noindent
An important observation: in the second law, if we take the force to be zero, then apparently $\vec{a}= \dv{v}{t} = 0\implies \vec{v} = \mathrm{const.}$ which is the statement of the first law. However, the second law does not imply the first law, since the first law defines what an \textit{inertial frame} is and the statement of the second law applies only in case of inertial frames. So, a better formulation of the second and third law can be like, ``In a frame where the first law is valid, blah blah blah...''
